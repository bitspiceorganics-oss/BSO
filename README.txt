# Bitspice Organics — Static Theme

This is a clean, responsive landing-page theme you can:
- Host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or your own server, **or**
- Embed into Google Sites via **Insert → Embed → By URL** (host the files first).

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — theme styles
- `script.js` — small interactivity
- `assets/` — put your logo and images here

## Replace assets
Put these files (or your own) inside `assets/`:
- `logo.png`
- `favicon.png`
- `cover.jpg`
- `assortment.jpg`, `ghost-pepper.jpg`, `turmeric.jpg`, `joha-rice.jpg`, `black-gram.jpg`

Update text and links right in `index.html`.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages quick)
1. Create a new GitHub repo and upload these files.
2. Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch (main), folder `/root`.
3. Copy the site URL.

## Embed in Google Sites
- In Google Sites, use **Insert → Embed → By URL**, paste your hosted URL (e.g., `https://yourname.github.io/bitspice-theme/`).
- This shows the entire coded theme without third‑party credits.
